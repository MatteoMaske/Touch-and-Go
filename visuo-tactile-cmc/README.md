# Visuo-tactile CMC
This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of our application visuo-tactile CMC in the paper paper [Touch and Go: Learning from Human-Collected Vision and Touch](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12498.pdf) .

## Environment
To setup the environment, please run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Touch and Go Dataset
Data can be downloaded from [Touch and Go Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NDasyshDCL9aaQzxjn_-Q5MBURRT360B).

### Preprocessing
- Convert Video into frames (within the dataset):
```bash
cd touch_and_go
python extract_frame.py
```

## Visuo-tactile CMC Training and Test
We provide training and evaluation scripts under `./scripts`, please check each bash file before running. Or you can run the code below:
- Pretraining
Example: To conduct visuo-tactile self-supervised learning for ResNet18, please run 
```bash
bash script/cmc_touch18.sh  
```
The checkpoints will be stored at `./ckpt/cmc`

- Downstream task
Example: Material Classification for ResNet18 linear probing pretrained from visuo-tactile cmc
```bash
bash material_cmc_touch18.sh
```
The checkpoints will be stored at `./ckpt/cls/`

Example: Hard/soft classification for ResNet18 linear probing pretrained from visuo-tactile cmc
```bash
bash hard_cmc_touch18.sh
```
The checkpoints will be stored at `./ckpt/hard/`

Example: Rough/smooth classification for ResNet18 linear probing pretrained from visuo-tactile cmc
```bash
bash rough_cmc_touch18.sh
```
The checkpoints will be stored at `./ckpt/rough/`

## Todo
- [x] Code for visuo-tactile CMC pretraining
- [x] Code for downstream tasks on Touch and Go dataset (i.e. material classification, hard/soft and rough/smooth classification)
- [] Pretrained model via our pretraining
